Changing the size and opacity of points on scatterplots can be used to
systematically improve viewers' perceptions of correlation. Evidence
points to these effects being similar with regards to the mechanisms
behind them, so one may expect that their combination would produce a
simple additive effect on correlation estimation. We present a
fully-reproducible study in which we combine techniques for influencing
correlation perception to show that in reality, effects of changing
point size and opacity interact in a non-additive fashion. We show that
there is a great deal of scope for using visual features to change
viewers' perceptions of data visualizations. Additionally, we use our
results to further interrogate the perceptual mechanisms at play when
changing point size and opacity in scatterplots.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Scatterplots are common bivariate representations of data. They have
been extensively studied and are used for a variety of communicative
tasks. While most commonly used to represent linear correlation, or the
degree of linear relatedness between two variables, they can also be
used to represent different groups (clustering), to aid in the detection
of outliers, to characterize distributions, and to visualize non-linear
correlations. Figure~\ref{fig-tasks} contains examples of scatterplots
optimized for different tasks. There is evidence that people generally
interpret scatterplots in similar ways \citep{kay_2015}, and that they
support the interpretation of correlation significantly better than
competing data visualizations \citep{li_2010}. Rapid interpretation by
viewers \citep{rensink_2014}, along with low levels of interindividual
variance render scatterplots particularly suited for experimental work;
they provide important insights into perception and visualization design
while being simple to study \citep{rensink_2014}.

While our interpretations of scatterplots are generally similar, the
accuracy of those interpretations is generally poor. In particular,
viewers systematically underestimate the correlation displayed in
positively correlated scatterplots. This holds true for direct
estimation tasks
\citep{strahan_1978, bobko_1979, cleveland_1982, lane_1985, lauer_1989, collyer_1990, meyer_1992},
and estimation via bisection tasks \citep{rensink_2017}, and is
particularly pronounced for values of \emph{r} between 0.2 and 0.6. The
COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that even outside of professional/office
environments, lay populations are now expected to be able to use and
accurately interpret data visualizations on a daily basis
\citep{bbc_2022}. This expectation confers a responsibility on the part
of data visualization designers to design in such ways that people with
limited statistical or graph training can expect to be able to correctly
interpret data visualizations. Doing this requires us to understand
human perception, apply this understanding to data visualization design,
and test those designs in rigorous empirical work. Here, we present a
fully-reproducible, crowdsourced online experiment in which we
systematically alter visual features in scatterplots to correct for a
well-known bias. We combine two techniques for correcting for
correlation underestimation in scatterplots and show that the effects
are stronger than what might be expected from simple additive
combination. Building on this, we present a framework for visualization
design informed from the ground up by human perception.

\subsection{Testing Correlation
Perception}\label{sec-testing-corr-percept}}

The testing of linear correlation perception in scatterplots has a long
and rich history, and has explored a wide variety of plot types, tasks,
and modeling methods. Work involving participants making discrimination
judgements between scatterplots with different correlations
\citep{pollack_1960, doherty_2007} found that performance on such tasks
became better as the objective \emph{r} value increased. This
performance on discrimination judgement tasks can also be modeled by
deep neural networks \citep{yang_2023}. Extensive work throughout the
1970s to 1990s focused primarily on having participants produce a
numerical estimate of correlation, and found evidence for a systematic
\emph{underestimation} for positive \emph{r} values besides 0 and 1.
This underestimation was especially pronounced for 0.2 \textless{}
\emph{r} \textless{} 0.6
\citep{strahan_1978, bobko_1979, cleveland_1982, lane_1985, lauer_1989, collyer_1990, meyer_1992}
and is demonstrated using an equation relating objective to subjective
correlation \citep{rensink_2017} in
Figure~\ref{fig-underestimation-curve}. More recent work has attempted
to model participants' correlation estimation performance by using a
combination of a bisection task, in which participants are asked to
adjust a plot until its correlation is halfway between that of two
reference plots, and a staircase method task designed to produce Just
Noticeable Differences between scatterplots such that their correlations
are discriminable 75\% of the time \citep{rensink_2010}. This work has
also been extended to incorporate Bayesian data analysis
\citep{kay_2015}, which also identifies scatterplots as particularly
suited for the communication of correlation
\citep{li_2010, harrison_2014}. The current experiment adapts techniques
from previous work \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b} and combines them
to further push the envelope of how systematically adjusting visual
features in scatterplots can radically alter people's perceptions of
correlation. For this reason we use the same direct estimation paradigm
to collect responses. This paradigm allows for a large number of
judgements to be collected, and is simple enough that participants need
little to no training.

\hypertarget{sec-drivers}{%
\subsection{Drivers of Correlation Perception}\label{sec-drivers}}

Evidence points towards correlation perception being driven by the shape
of the underlying probability distribution represented by scatterplot
points, however it should be noted that this is very much still an open
question, especially with regards to what low level perceptual
mechanisms may be at play. It is possible that there are different
contributory perceptual mechanisms operating at different levels based
on task-specific differences such as viewing time or levels of
graph-training. Increasing the \emph{x} and \emph{y} scales on a
scatterplot such that the size of the point cloud decreases
\citep{cleveland_1982} is associated with an increase in a viewer's
judgements of bivariate association, despite the objective \emph{r}
value remaining the same. It was suggested in this case that viewers may
have been using the area of the point cloud to judge association. Later
work found that the relationship between objective and perceived
\emph{r} values could be described by a function that included the mean
of the geometric distances between the points and the regression line
\citep{meyer_1997}. Investigation of the idea that people use visual
features to judge correlation provides evidence that, among three other
equally predictive features, the standard deviation of all perpendicular
distances from scatterplot points to the regression line is predictive
of performance on a correlation estimation task \citep{yang_2019}.
Equations for both discrimination and magnitude estimation of \emph{r}
in scatterplots include a quantity that is small when \emph{r} = 1 and
increases as \emph{r} approaches 0 \citep{rensink_2017}. This quantity
is indifferent to the type of visualization used, and is functionally
similar to that found in work mentioned above
\citep{cleveland_1982, meyer_1997, yang_2019}. Regarding scatterplots,
this quantity represents the average distance between data points and
the regression line, and can be thought of as closely approximating the
width of the underlying probability distribution. Findings from a
convolutional neural network that learnt visual features related to
correlation perception also support the idea that viewers are using an
aspect of scatterplot shape to judge correlation, or some measure of
what has been termed \emph{dot entropy} \citep{yang_2023}, again
considered a candidate visual proxy for correlation judgements
\citep{rensink_2017, rensink_2022}.

Recent work investigating the use of decay functions that change point
size or opacity in scatterplots as a function of residual distance
provide evidence for both point density and salience/perceptual
weighting being drivers of correlation perception. The use of an
inverted opacity decay function \citep{strain_2023}, such that the
opacity of a point decreased the closer it was to the regression line,
resulted in significantly lower and less accurate correlation estimates
compared to uniformly full-opacity plots with the same overall shape.
This finding suggests that the lower opacity in the center of the
scatterplot biased viewers' perceptions down. When point opacity or size
are reduced as a function of distance from the regression line
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}, viewers rate correlation as
significantly higher and are significantly more accurate. This supports
a low-level data salience account. Our aims are to test the impact of
systematically altering visual features on correlation perception and to
provide empirically-derived tools for visualization designers to design
better visualizations informed by the use of a simple, reproducible
framework.

\caption{\label{fig-alpha-examples}Demonstrating the effects of
different alpha values on point opacity}

\end{figure}

Changing the opacity of scatterplot points is standard practice to deal
with issues of overplotting \citep{matejka_2015}; scatterplots with very
large numbers of points, especially those with high degrees of overlap,
suffer from low individual-point visibility caused by high point
density. Lowering the opacity of all points using alpha blending
\citep{few_2008} addresses this, and makes data trends and distributions
easier to see and interpret (see
Figure~\ref{fig-overplotting-examples}). In the present study we use the
\textbf{ggplot2} package \citep{hadley_gg2016} to create our stimuli.
This package uses an alpha parameter, or the level of linear
interpolation \citep{stone_2008} between foreground and background pixel
values, to set the opacity of points. As demonstrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-alpha-examples}, an alpha value of 0 or 1 results in no
interpolation and rendering of either the background or foreground pixel
values respectively. Regarding the related concept of contrast,
psychophysical definitions are often based on what is being presented
(e.g., gratings) or are modeled to take into account aspects of human
vision (e.g., visibility limits) \citep{zuffi_2007}. Our crowdsourced
methodology gives us no control over the exact luminances of our
stimuli, only over the \emph{relative} differences in luminance between
scatterplot points and backgrounds. For this reason we do not report
absolute luminance nor make any attempt to adopt a formal definition of
contrast; instead we report the alpha value used. Given that our work
aims to improve correlation perception without removing data from the
scatterplot, we also incorporate point visibility testing (see
Section~\ref{sec-VT}). Informal point visibility piloting suggested that
our smallest, lowest opacity points had very low visibility. We
therefore implemented an alpha = 0.2 floor for these points, which we
judged as conferring a sufficient level of point visibility.

Previous work has found that lowering the opacity of \emph{all}
scatterplot points relative to the background can increase the level of
underestimation error relative to full opacity, and that lowering point
opacity \emph{as a function of distance from the regression line} is
able to bias correlation estimates upwards to partially correct for the
underestimation observed \citep{strain_2023}. Evidence suggests point
salience/perceptual weighting or spatial uncertainty as drivers for this
effect. Lower stimulus contrast, which for isolated stimuli is
functionally identical to lower opacity, is associated with lower
salience \citep{healey_2011}, can bias judgements of mean point position
\citep{hong_2021}, increase error in positional judgements
\citep{wehrhahn_1990}, and can result in greater uncertainty in speed
perception \citep{champion_2017}. Due to mechanistic accounts of both
salience/perceptual weighting and spatial uncertainty predicting results
in the same direction, previous work \citep{strain_2023} has been unable
to determine the extent to which each is responsible for the observed
reduction in correlation estimation error.

Micallef et al. \citep{micallef_2017} also found that ``merging, dark
dots'' optimally support correlation estimation; despite only changing
point opacity in a \emph{uniform} manner, the sheer number of points
used for the scatterplots in that study result in points that appear
similar to those that reduce opacity as a function of residual error
\citep{strain_2023}. Given that this technique has been shown to produce
more accurate correlation estimates as compared to unadjusted
scatterplots, this may explain the results of the optimization system
employed in Micallef et al. \citep{micallef_2017}

\hypertarget{sec-point-size}{%
\subsection{Point Size}\label{sec-point-size}}

For discriminability reasons, scatterplots visualizing large datasets
tend also to have smaller points. Bubble charts are a subclass of
scatterplot which use point size to describe a third variable, but what
little experimental work there is on the impact of point size on
correlation perception is inconclusive. Some work has found bias and
variability in correlation perception to be invariant to changes in
point size \citep{rensink_2012, rensink_2014}, while elsewhere a strong
effect of changing point size as a function of distance from the
regression line has been reported \citep{strain_2023b}. Evidence points
towards a salience-dominant mechanism in the latter case, albeit with a
small effect of spatial uncertainty. There is evidence that larger
stimulus size is associated with lower levels of spatial certainty
\citep{alais_2004}, but higher levels of salience \citep{healey_2011},
results which are supported by evidence that reaction times are slower
to smaller stimuli \citep{gramazio_2014, osaka_1976}. The predicted
effects of these drivers on correlation perception work in the opposite
direction to one another, which has allowed researchers to provide
evidence for the mechanistic dominance of salience when point size is
used. When an inverted size decay function is used such that smaller
points are located nearer the regression line, correlation estimation is
significantly more accurate than when all points are the same size
\citep{strain_2023b}. In this case it was suggested that the higher
spatial uncertainty brought on by larger exterior points caused a
perceptual downweighting during correlation estimation, which is in line
with work suggesting our perceptual systems make robust use of
visuo-spatial information
\citep{strain_2023b, warren_2002, warren_2004}. This effect was small,
meaning we do not take it into account when making our hypotheses. Our
hypotheses do, however, take into account the wider body of evidence
regarding stimulus size, perception, and attention. Hong et al.
\citep{hong_2021} found that larger stimuli could significantly alter
perceptions of global scatterplot means.

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

We present a single experiment based on established effects of adjusting
point size and point opacity In our study, we combine previously
independently tested point size and point opacity decay functions in
both typical orientation (opacity/size is reduced with residual
magnitude) and inverted orientation (opacity/size is increased with
residual magnitude). Throughout we refer to \emph{congruent} and
\emph{incongruent} conditions with respect to the combination of
orientations of size and opacity decay functions. Note that the use of
this terminology is unrelated to the concept of redundant encoding
\citep{nothelfer_2017}. We hypothesize that: (H1) an increased reduction
in correlation estimation error will be observed when congruent typical
orientation decay functions are used; (H2) the use of congruent inverted
orientation decay functions will produce the least accurate estimates of
correlation; and (H3) that owing to the greater strength of the size
channel observed in previous work \citep{strain_2023b}, there will be a
significant difference in correlation estimates between the two
incongruent orientation conditions.

\hypertarget{sec-methods}{%
\section{Methodology}\label{sec-methods}}

In this section we begin by discussing our general research methods,
including our approach to crowdsourcing, our implementations of open
research practices, and the modelling methods we use to test our
hypotheses. We also discuss the particular issues that arise with
regards to the use of these methods in our particular research paradigm.
We then report on two additional pre-experimental tests that
participants completed, point visibility testing and a screen scaling
task to assess dot pitch. This section concludes by reporting on
experimental procedure, participant recruitment and characteristics, and
the experimental design itself.

\hypertarget{sec-crowdsourcing}{%
\subsection{Crowdsourcing}\label{sec-crowdsourcing}}

Much prior work into correlation perception in scatterplots has taken
place in-person, most often with graduate students with experience in
statistics. While this work is valuable, especially to perception
audiences, it can struggle to provide data that is resilient to
different viewing contexts and the wide range of levels of statistical
and graph experience present in lay populations. In addition, the ease
and low-cost afforded to us by online, crowdsourced experimental work is
unmatched. Given our intended HCI and design audience, we therefore
choose to crowdsource all participants. We acknowledge however, that the
technique has been affected by low quality data and skewed demographics
in the past \citep{chmielewski_2020, charalambides_2021, peer_2021}. In
light of these issues we follow published guidelines \citep{peer_2021}
to ensure the collection of high quality data. Namely, we use the
Prolific.co platform \citep{prolific} with stringent pre-screen
restrictions; participants were required to have completed at least 100
studies using Prolific, and were required to have a prolific score of
100, representing a 99\% approval rate. This is more strict than the
95\% suggested in previous work \citep{peer_2021}, but has served the
authors well in prior work.

\hypertarget{sec-open-research}{%
\subsection{Open Research}\label{sec-open-research}}

This study was conducted according to the principles of open and
reproducible research \citep{ayris_2018}. All data and analysis code are
available at (repository link removed for anon). This repository
contains instructions for building a Docker container to fully reproduce
the computational environment used. This allows for full replications of
stimuli, analyses, and the paper itself. Ethical approval was granted by
(removed for anon). Hypotheses and analysis plans were pre-registered
with the OSF (links removed for anon) and there were no deviations from
them.

\hypertarget{sec-gen-modelling}{%
\subsection{Modeling}\label{sec-gen-modelling}}

We use linear mixed effects models to model the relationships between
the combination of size and opacity decay functions and participants'
errors in correlation estimates. Models such as these allow us to
compare differences in our IV across the full range of participant
responses, as opposed to relying purely on aggregate data, as in ANOVA.
These models also afford us the ability to include random effects for
participants and items. As per our pre-registrations we preferred
maximal models \citep{barr_2013}, including random intercepts and slopes
for participants and items. The structures of these models were
identified using the \textbf{buildmer} package (version 2.10.1,
\citep{voeten_buildmer}) in R. This package takes a maximal random
effects structure and then identifies the most complex model that
converges by dropping terms that fail to explain a significant amount of
variance.

\hypertarget{sec-scatter-gen}{%
\subsection{Stimuli}\label{sec-scatter-gen}}

45 scatterplot datasets were generated corresponding to 45 \emph{r}
values uniformly distributed between 0.2 and 0.99, as there is evidence
that very little correlation is perceived below \emph{r} = 0.2
\citep{strahan_1978, bobko_1979, cleveland_1982}. Using so many values
for \emph{r} allows us to paint a broader picture of people's perception
than work using fewer values. Scatterplot points were generated based on
bivariate normal distributions with standard deviations of 1 in each
direction. In line with evidence that performance on correlation
perception tasks is stable as long as the number of points remains above
48 \citep{rensink_2014} and to facilitate comparison with previous
studies \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}. Each scatterplot was created
and presented using a 1:1 aspect ratio, in line with findings that this
facilitates optimal performance on correlation estimation tasks
\citep{micallef_2017}. Scatterplots were generated as 1000 x 1000 pixel
.png images, and were scaled up or down according to a participant's
monitor such that they always occupied the same proportion of the
screen. Note that this results in reductions in scatterplot point size
in proportion with the size of the plot itself. Variations in size such
as these have been associated with lower levels of colour/opacity
discriminability \citep{szafir_2018, smart_2019}. As we only allowed
participants to complete the experiment on a desktop/laptop computer, we
do not consider the variations in point size to be worthy of extended
discussion, especially as there was little reported effect of dot pitch
(see Section~\ref{sec-add-analyses}). We used equation 1 to map
residuals to size and opacity values:

\begin{equation}
  point_{size/opacity} = 1 - b^{residual}
\end{equation}

When adjusting point size, we further transform values using a scaling
factor of 4 and a constant of 0.2 to ensure that the minimum point size
in the present study is both visible and consistent with that of
previous work \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}. 0.25 was chosen as the
value of \emph{b}. This value was used in previous studies that the
present work builds upon, and it produces a curve approximating the
inverse around the identity line of the underestimation curve reported
in previous work \citep{rensink_2017, strain_2023, strain_2023b}. We
acknowledge that there may be other, more suitable values of \emph{b},
however extensive testing of these is outside the scope of the present
work. We used this equation in typical and inverted orientation forms
applied to point size and opacity in a factorial 2 x 2 design. Examples
of the stimuli used can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig-examples}.

\hypertarget{sec-VT}{%
\subsection{Point Visibility Testing}\label{sec-VT}}

Discussions about the size and opacity of particular scatterplot points
are inherently difficult in the context of online, crowdsourced
experiments; controlling the devices participants use to participate in
these kinds of experiments, beyond insisting on laptop or desktop
computers, is impossible. While this may result in a lack of consistency
in scatterplot point sizes, luminances, or contrast ratios between
participants, it also provides results that are more resilient to
different viewing contexts than traditional lab-based experimental work.
In addition to measures implemented to ensure high quality participant
data (see Section~\ref{sec-crowdsourcing}), it is also key that we do
not inadvertently remove data from scatterplots by including points
whose size or opacity renders them invisible. We therefore included
point visibility testing to check this. Participants viewed six
scatterplots that were made up of a certain number of points between 2
and 7. These points were of the same size and opacity as the smallest
and lowest opacity points used in the experimental items. Participants
were asked to enter in a textbox how many points were present.
Participants scored an average of 74.89\% (\(SD\) = 32.25\%). Despite
our use of the opacity floor detailed in
Section~\ref{sec-transparency-and-contrast}, it is clear that some of
our small, low opacity points were not reliably visible, most likely due
to low contrast between the point and background, as previous work
\citep{strain_2023b} found point visibility largely invariant to size.
We suggest this is due to differences in monitor specifications between
participants. In reality minimum visible size and opacity would need to
be calibrated on a per-monitor basis. We also include performance on the
point visibility test as a fixed effect in
Section~\ref{sec-add-analyses}.

\hypertarget{sec-dot-pitch}{%
\subsection{Dot Pitch}\label{sec-dot-pitch}}

We employed a method for obtaining the dot pitch of participants'
monitors \citep{screenscale}. We define dot pitch as the distance in
millimetres between the centers of the pixels on a participants'
monitor. Combining this with monitor resolution information allows us to
calculate the physical on-screen size of scatterplot points.
Participants were asked to hold a standard size credit/debit/ID card
(ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1) up to their screen and resize an on-screen card
until their sizes matched. We assumed a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio and
calculated dot pitch based on these measurements. Mean dot pitch was
0.60mm (\(SD\) = 0.09), corresponding to a physical on-screen size of
7.80mm on a 1920 x 1080 pixel monitor for the smallest points displayed.
We include analyses with dot pitch as a fixed effect in
Section~\ref{sec-add-analyses}.

\hypertarget{sec-gen-procedure}{%
\subsection{Procedure}\label{sec-gen-procedure}}

Both experiments were built using PsychoPy \citep{pierce_2019} and
hosted on Pavlovia.org. Participants were only permitted to complete the
experiment on a desktop or laptop computer. Each participant was first
shown the participant information sheet and provided consent through key
presses in response to consent statements. They were asked to provide
their age in a free text box, followed by their gender identity.
Participants completed the 5-item Subjective Graph Literacy test
\citep{garcia_2016}, followed by the point visibility task described in
Section~\ref{sec-VT} and the screen scale task described in
Section~\ref{sec-dot-pitch}. Participants were given instructions, and
were then shown examples of scatterplots with correlations of \emph{r} =
0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.95, as piloting of a previous experiment indicated
some of the lay population may be unfamiliar with the visual character
of scatterplots. Section~\ref{sec-add-analyses} contains further
analysis of the potential training effects of this. Two practice trials
were given before the experiment began. Participants worked through a
randomly presented series of 180 experimental trials and were asked to
use a slider to estimate correlation to 2 decimal places. Participants
were asked to complete each trial as quickly and accurately as possible,
although there were no time limits on individual trials. Visual masks
were displayed for 1 second in between each scatterplot presentations.
Interspersed were 6 attention check trials which explicitly asked
participants to ignore the scatterplot and set the slider to 0 or 1.

\hypertarget{sec-participants}{%
\subsection{Participants}\label{sec-participants}}

150 participants were recruited using the Prolific.co platform. Normal
to corrected-to-normal vision and English fluency were required for
participation. In addition, participants who had completed any of our
previous studies into correlation estimation in scatterplots (references
removed for anon) were prevented from participating. Data were collected
from 158 participants. 8 failed more than 2 out of 6 attention check
questions, and, as per pre-registration stipulations, were rejected from
the study. Data from the remaining 150 participants were included in the
full analysis (50.7\% male, 48.7\% female, and 0.7\% non-binary).
Participants' mean age was 30.6 (\emph{SD} = 8.6). Participants' mean
graph literacy score was 22.5 (\emph{SD} = 3.5). The average time taken
to complete the experiment was 37 minutes (\emph{SD} = 12.3).
Section~\ref{sec-add-analyses} contains a discussion of the time taken
to complete the experiment.

\hypertarget{sec-design}{%
\subsection{Design}\label{sec-design}}

We used a fully repeated-measures 2 x 2 factorial design. Each
participant saw each combination of size and opacity decay function
plots for a total of 180 experimental items. Participants viewed these
experimental items, along with 6 attention check items, in a fully
randomized order. All experimental code, materials, and instructions are
hosted at (link removed for anon).

\hypertarget{sec-results}{%
\section{Results}\label{sec-results}}

All analyses were conducted using R (version 4.3.1). Deviation coding
was used for each of the experimental factors. We used the
\textbf{buildmer} and \textbf{lme4} (version 1.1-34 \citep{lme4})
packages to build a linear mixed effects model where the difference
between objective and rated \emph{r} value was predicted by the size and
opacity decay functions used. Semi-partial R\textsuperscript{2} was
calculated using the \textbf{r2glmm} package (version 0.1.2
\citep{r2glmm}). The \textbf{emmeans} package (version 1.8.8
\citep{emmeans}) was used to calculate pairwise comparisons between
levels of the size and opacity decay factor.

Our first two hypotheses were fully supported in this experiment. The
combination of typical orientation size and opacity decay functions
produced the most accurate estimates of correlation, although this also
resulted in a large over-correction and consequent overestimation for
many values of \emph{r} (see Figure~\ref{fig-diff-error-bars-plot}). Our
second hypothesis was also supported; the combination of inverted size
and inverted opacity decay functions produced the least accurate
estimates of correlation. We found no support for our third hypothesis;
there was no significant difference in correlation estimates between
typical orientation size/inverted orientation opacity decay plots and
inverted orientation size/typical orientation opacity decay plots (Z =
-2.26, \emph{p} = .11), however we did find a significant interaction
effect that provides evidence that the combination of size and opacity
decay functions is not additive in nature.

A likelihood ratio test revealed that the model including point size and
opacity decay conditions as fixed effects explained significantly more
variance than the null (\(\chi^2\)(3) = 5,286.81, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001). There were significant fixed effects of size decay and opacity
decay, as well as a significant interaction between the two. The
experimental model has random intercepts for items and participants, and
a random slope for the size decay factor with regards to participants.
Due both to our use of a linear mixed model with an interaction term,
and our lack of a comparative baseline condition (i.e no size or opacity
function used), we do not report a traditional measure of effect size.
Instead we report the amounts of variance explained by each fixed effect
term and the interaction term as semi-partial R\textsuperscript{2}
\citep{nakagawa_2013}, which can be see in Table~\ref{tbl-sig} along
with all model statistics. Pairwise comparisons between levels of the
size and opacity decay factor can be seen in Table~\ref{tbl-contrasts}.

\hypertarget{sec-add-analyses}{%
\subsection{Additional Analyses}\label{sec-add-analyses}}

We find no effects of graph literacy (\(\chi^2\)(1) = 3.50, \emph{p} =
.061), performance on the point visibility task (\(\chi^2\)(1) = 1.29,
\emph{p} = .257), or dot pitch (\(\chi^2\)(1) = 1.52, \emph{p} = .218)
on participants' errors in correlation estimation. We did find a
significant effect of training (\(\chi^2\)(1) = 23.78, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001), with participants rating correlation .01 lower during
the second half. This may imply that having more recently viewed the
four training plots described in Section~\ref{sec-gen-procedure}
increased participants' estimates of correlation. To analyse the
potential variability of participant responses in more detail, we build
a model including trial number. As the presentation of experimental
stimuli were randomised separately for each participant, this allows us
to examine responses purely as a function of \emph{when} they were made.
We find a significant effect of trial number on participant's errors
(\(\chi^2\)(1) = 29.31, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).
Figure~\ref{fig-time-plot} shows participants' unsigned mean errors in
correlation estimation against trial number. Variability in error, as
represented by the ribbon in Figure~\ref{fig-time-plot}, stabilises
quickly and remains stable for most of the experiment, only widening
again around trial number 170. We suggest that this is a result of
participants knowing that they were coming to the end of the experiment
and being less vigilant as a result. Regardless of its significance, we
do not consider this effect large enough to warrant further analysis,
although future work will take into account potential effects of
experimental length.

\hypertarget{sec-discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}}

The finding of a significant interaction between point size and opacity
decay provides evidence that these functions interact in non-additive
ways. In addition, we provide further confirmatory evidence of what has
been found previously. Namely, that while manipulations of both point
size and opacity have significant effects, the effect of changing point
size is stronger, and that while we can influence correlation estimates
in either direction, typical orientation manipulations are more powerful
than inverted ones \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}. As one would
expect, we also see an effect of orientation congruency on the extent to
which a manipulation can bias correlation estimates. The lack of support
for our third hypothesis, that there would be a difference in
correlation estimates between incongruent conditions, was surprising
given the greater strength of the size channel relative to opacity
demonstrated in previous work \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b},
although this may be a facet of the non-additive interaction between
size and opacity manipulations we found. Despite the lack of support for
this hypothesis, we did find that the size decay channel explained more
variance (.104) in our model than opacity decay (.087) was able to.

Taking into account the present work, which manipulates point size and
opacity together, and previous work manipulating the same visual
features in isolation, we provide recommendations to visualization
designers and researchers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When \emph{r} is between approximately 0.3 and 0.75, and the
  scatterplot in question is intended solely for the communication of
  correlation, designers may wish to implement the size decay function,
  as previous work \citep{strain_2023b} has shown it to produce the most
  accurate correlation estimates in this range.
\item
  Outside of this range, and with the same caveats in place, designers
  may wish to implement the opacity decay function; while its effect on
  correlation estimation is small, it does significantly increase
  estimation accuracy.
\item
  There exists a combination of size and opacity decay functions that
  produces accurate correlation estimates while maintaining the
  increased \emph{r} estimation precision that we would expect to see
  with high \emph{r} values. Finding this will require extensive future
  testing.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sec-combining}{%
\subsection{Combining Manipulations}\label{sec-combining}}

Figure~\ref{fig-emm-plot} and Figure~\ref{fig-diff-error-bars-plot} show
how, on average, the combination of typical orientation size and opacity
decay functions has resulted in an overestimation of \emph{r} for the
majority of values. While this does not directly solve the
underestimation problem, it does demonstrate that with regards to using
point size and opacity to bias viewer's estimates of correlation in
scatterplots, there would appear to be few limitations. If we can
over-correct correlation estimates, then we certainly have the ability
to correct appropriately. The issue here is not one of our
\emph{ability} to change people's perceptions, but of \emph{tuning} the
use of these visual factors to be able to change people's perceptions in
systematic ways. We explore what further work would need to be done to
do this in Section~\ref{sec-future-work}. Combining inverted size and
opacity decay functions also had the predicted effect in this case,
producing the lowest and least accurate estimates of correlation.
Combining inverted manipulations did not, however, significantly change
the shape of the estimation curve (see
Figure~\ref{fig-diff-error-bars-plot}). In addition to interacting
non-additively, the effects we observe operate differently depending on
the direction of the change induced in perception. This finding can also
explain the lack of support found for our hypothesis that there would be
a significant difference in \emph{r} estimation error between the two
incongruent conditions. Despite the size channel being more powerful
with regards to influencing correlation estimates, the fact that this
power depends on the direction the function is set causes incongruent
functions to act against each other in ways we would not expect. Indeed,
the incongruent condition that used a typical orientation size decay
function did exhibit lower mean error than the one using inverted
orientation size decay (see Figure~\ref{fig-diff-error-bars-plot}),
however in each case the opacity decay appears to have blunted the power
of the size decay function to the extent that the difference in errors
is not statistically significant.

\hypertarget{estimation-precision}{%
\subsection{Estimation Precision}\label{estimation-precision}}

Much previous work is consistent with regards to the finding that
\emph{r} estimation precision increases with the objective \emph{r}
value
\citep{rensink_2010, rensink_2012, rensink_2014, rensink_2017, doherty_2007}.
More recent work using size or opacity decay functions similar to the
ones used here \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b} has found that in some
cases, precision in \emph{r} estimation is \emph{constant} across the
range of \emph{r} values investigated. For example, the use of a size
decay function, whether using typical/inverted orientation non-linear
functions or a linear decay function, results in \textbf{no} change in
\emph{r} estimation precision \citep{strain_2023b}. When opacity is used
in the same ways, only an inverted decay function \textbf{does not}
exhibit the conventional increase in precision with \emph{r}. In the
present work, precision in \emph{r} estimation increased whenever a
typical orientation opacity decay function was used. We suggest this is
part of the moderating effect of the point opacity decay function on the
size decay function; the visual character of scatterplots with high
\emph{r} values that use the size decay function eliminates the usual
increase in precision we would expect, however the introduction of the
opacity decay function normalizes this to the point where precision is
restored.

\hypertarget{contributions-of-size-and-opacity-decay}{%
\subsection{Contributions of Size and Opacity
Decay}\label{contributions-of-size-and-opacity-decay}}

Incorporating data from previous work \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}
that used similar decay functions and experimental paradigms allows us
to compare estimation curves for size decay and opacity decay in
isolation and in combination. Figure~\ref{fig-est-multi-exp} shows
correlation estimation error curves in the present experiment, in two
previous studies that used decay functions applied solely to size or
opacity, and with no manipulations present. This final plot is averaged
over conditions from previous work.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth,height=\textheight]{size_and_opacity_files/figure-pdf/fig-est-multi-exp-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-est-multi-exp}Plotting \emph{r} estimation error
against the objective \emph{r} value for opacity and size decay in
isolation from previous work, and for their combination in the present
study. The dashed line represents 0 error in correlation estimation, and
standard deviations are shown as error bars. Note that these curves have
been smoothed. Overestimation occurs above the dashed line. The plot
line for the plot without manipulation was averaged from previous work.}

\end{figure}

Using opacity decay alone significantly changes the amplitude of
estimation error curve, while leaving its shape intact (compare opacity
manipulated and no manipulation present plots in
Figure~\ref{fig-est-multi-exp}). Using size decay, however, changes both
the amplitude and shape of the underestimation error curve (compare size
manipulated and no manipulation present plots in
Figure~\ref{fig-est-multi-exp}). When size and opacity decay functions
are combined, however, the shape appears similar to that of size alone.
This is in line with previous work establishing size as a more potent
channel for the manipulation of correlation estimates
\citep{strain_2023b}. It would appear that the addition of the opacity
curve moderates the effect of the size curve as a function of the
objective \emph{r} value itself, without affecting the general shape of
the curve. In the following, we briefly discuss the effects of each
manipulation in isolation and the manipulations together, before making
a case for the inclusion of both when tuning scatterplots for
correlation estimation due to the complementary benefits each confers.
Throughout the course of this section it should be noted that the
analyses include data from several separate experiments. We argue that
their methodological similarities render comparison appropriate, but we
acknowledge the potential for overstated conclusions.

Using a opacity decay function in isolation has a small effect on
correlation estimation. It does little to change the shape of the
underestimation curve (see Figure~\ref{fig-underestimation-curve}), but
slightly biases \emph{r} estimates up to partially correct for the
underestimation observed with normal scatterplots \citep{strain_2023}.
Importantly, it also preserves the increase in correlation estimation
precision that we would expect to find during correlation estimation
tasks. Using the size decay function in isolation has a more dramatic
effect. The shape of the estimation curve is altered quite radically,
and there is no increase in precision with the objective \emph{r} value
\citep{strain_2023b}. Size decay over-corrects at lower values of
\emph{r}, leading to an overestimation effect, while at high values the
curve begins to change direction, leading to a more severe
underestimation. In the middle range of \emph{r} values, however, the
size decay function in isolation performs well. One option for tuning
correlation estimation using these functions would therefore be to use
the size decay function in isolation for mid-range values of \emph{r}
(0.3 to 0.75), and to use the opacity decay function in isolation
outside of this range. Used together however, we can exploit the power
of the size decay function whilst maintaining the expected increase in
precision with \emph{r} that the opacity decay function confers. It is
clear that the simple combination we have used in the present study does
not represent an ideal tuning, as participants overestimated \emph{r}
for the majority of values, but this confirms that there is the scope to
bias \emph{r} estimates significantly using the functions supplied here.
Further work would be required to obtain precise measures of the
contributions of each decay function when they are used together, as
their combination is not linearly additive. Doing this would allow us to
tune each function according to both objective \emph{r} value and the
tuning of the other function to facilitate accurate correlation
estimates. We can derive new curves that describe the effect that each
manipulation and the combination of manipulations has on correlation
estimates (Figure~\ref{fig-power-plot}) by comparing them to estimates
without any manipulation present. We term this `power'. The dotted line
on each plot shows the power we would need to correct for the standard
underestimation curve (see Figure~\ref{fig-underestimation-curve}). As
we can see, size alone provides the closest to the requirement, and
combining size and opacity decay functions results in gross
overestimation.

\subsection{Mechanisms}\label{sec-mechs}}

Previous work has made the case for opacity and size decay acting
primarily through salience/perceptual weighting, with the caveat that
spatial certainty also plays a small part in the mechanism behind size
decay \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}. Our results are supportive of
this notion, with our highest and lowest estimates being observed in the
congruent standard and congruent inverted conditions respectively. These
findings also support dot density \citep{yang_2023} and feature-based
attentional bias accounts \citep{hong_2021, sun_2016}. As all of these
mechanisms would be expected to operate in the same direction, making
conclusions about the relative contributions of each is difficult. The
body of evidence generally points to a high-level probability
distribution account \citep{rensink_2017, rensink_2022}. On a lower
level, numerous candidate mechanisms exist, which are mostly expected to
act in the same direction. Previous work concluded that spatial
certainty \citep{strain_2023b} may play a small role with regards to the
effects of size decay on correlation perception; our results neither
confirm nor refute this, but instead provide further evidence for
salience/perceptual weighting/dot density changing participants'
perceptions of the width of a probability distribution to affect
correlation estimates.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{sec-limitations}}

Firstly, our participants' performance on the point visibility task was
poor, with an average score of only 74.89\%. It is clear from these
results that for many participants, the smallest and lowest opacity
points we used were simply not visible, although it would seem that this
low visibility had no significant effect on correlation estimates.
Regardless, for many of our participants it will have appeared that we
were removing data, which violates our intended aims. Solving this would
require a by-participant calibration of point size and point opacity,
which is beyond the scope of our current methodology, as it would
require stimuli to be fully re-generated for each participant. We aim to
implement this in the future, although it would require a different
platform, such as a server-based instance of Rstudio being run in the
background to re-generate stimuli per a calibration task completed by
the participant. We cannot say precisely what proportions of the
observed effect in the typical orientation congruent condition were due
to size or opacity decay. We can conclude that these effects are not
linearly additive, but must suggest further work to define precisely
each of their contributions. While our provision of dot pitch
measurements is a step in the right direction, the present methodology
leaves us unable to comment on variability in participants' viewing
contexts. We argue that our large sample size and recruitment from lay
populations renders our conclusions resilient to changes in viewing
contexts, but further, in-person, experimentation is planned to confirm
this.

Channels such as point size, colour, opacity, and shape have been used
in past work to encode variables beyond the standard two in scatterplots
{[}\citet{hong_2021}; smart\_2019{]}. While we focus purely on
correlation estimation in the present work, we acknowledge that the use
of our techniques is likely to lead to incorrect interpretations. Given
that there is evidence that size, shape, and colour and not entirely
separable scatterplot features \citep{smart_2019}, there is the danger
that viewers might assume that variations in point size/opacity
correspond to additional encoded variables. As our contribution in this
paper is providing evidence that changing certain visual features in
systematic ways can alter viewer's estimates of correlation, we do not
consider this to be problematic. If charts such as the ones we have
presented were to appear in the wild, however, it would be necessary to
clarify that such charts were designed to aid in the rapid and intuitive
interpretation of correlation (and \emph{only} this).

\hypertarget{sec-future-work}{%
\subsection{Future Work}\label{sec-future-work}}

There is evidence that viewers overestimate correlation in negatively
correlated scatterplots \citep{sher_2017}. Due to evidence that
correlation perception in negatively correlation scatterplots functions
symmetrically to that of positively correlated scatterplots
\citep{harrison_2014}, the techniques we have implemented in the current
paper may be used in future (in a symmetrical manner) to address the
overestimation bias. We found evidence that the influence of size and
opacity decay functions changes according to the direction they are
operating in, meaning experimental work with negatively correlated
scatterplots would be required, and results may differ significantly
from findings related to the underestimation of correlation in
positively correlated scatterplots. For size and opacity decay in the
present work we used equation 1. Given our finding that the combination
is non-additive, there are a multitude of adjustable parameters for each
decay function that require rigorous testing in order to produce
concrete values of the contributions of each. The value of \emph{b} is
one such parameter. We used the same value of \emph{b} (0.25) as in
previous work \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}. Changing this value can
increase or decrease the severity of the effect in question.
Additionally, we used a constant and a scaling factor with the size
decay manipulation to ensure our points were visible. These values could
also be changed. Aside from changing aspects of equation 1, there are
other equations that could be used, including ones that take into
account objective \emph{r} value to change the values used to set point
size or opacity. Future experimental work may use the major axis through
the probability ellipse instead of the regression line as a baseline to
change point sizes and opacities; evidence that people often report the
major axis when asked to visually estimate the regression line
\citep{collyer_1990} suggests that this may produce a different pattern
of results from those seen here. The present study opens the door for
this future work, as it provides the necessary additional data to
previous experiments using only size \citep{strain_2023b} or opacity
\citep{strain_2023} decay functions. Further testing of these
manipulations in isolation and combination using different decay
function parameters will allow researchers to build a more complete
picture of how these visual features impact correlation estimation, and
how we can exploit them to correct for well-known biases.

Through this work we also provide an example of an experimental
framework that we argue should be employed to test a wider range of data
visualizations, statistical summaries, and task types. Our framework is
fully open source, and can be easily adapted for other charts and
modalities. Doing this furthers the cause of empirically-informed data
visualization design.
