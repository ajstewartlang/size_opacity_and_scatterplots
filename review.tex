\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Scatterplots are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{common bivariate representations of data. They have
been extensively studied and are }\DIFdelend used for a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{wide }\DIFaddend variety of communicative tasks\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, both in
academic and non-academic contexts}\DIFaddend . While most commonly used to
represent linear correlation, or the degree of linear relatedness
between two variables, they can also be used to represent different
groups (clustering), to aid in the detection of outliers, to
characterize distributions, and to visualize non-linear correlations.
Figure~\ref{fig-tasks} contains examples of scatterplots optimized for
different tasks. There is evidence that people generally interpret
scatterplots in similar ways \citep{kay_2015}, and that they support the
interpretation of correlation significantly better than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{other }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{competing }\DIFaddend data
visualizations \citep{li_2010}. Rapid interpretation by viewers
\citep{rensink_2014}, along with low levels of interindividual variance
render scatterplots particularly suited for experimental work; they
provide important insights into perception and visualization design
while being simple to study \citep{rensink_2014}.

While our interpretations of scatterplots are generally similar, the
accuracy of those interpretations is generally poor. In particular,
viewers systematically underestimate the correlation displayed in
positively correlated scatterplots. This holds true for direct
estimation
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tasks
}\DIFdelend \citep{strahan_1978, bobko_1979, cleveland_1982, lane_1985, lauer_1989, collyer_1990, meyer_1992}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
}\DIFdelend and estimation via bisection tasks \citep{rensink_2017}, and is
particularly pronounced for values of \emph{r} between 0.2 and 0.6. The
COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{even outside of professional/office
environments, lay populations}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{lay populations, in addition to
those who work with data professionally, }\DIFaddend are now expected to be able to
use and accurately interpret data visualizations on a daily basis
\citep{bbc_2022}. This expectation confers a responsibility on the part
of data visualization designers to design in such \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a way }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ways }\DIFaddend that people with
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{little }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{limited }\DIFaddend statistical or graph training \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can expect to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend able to correctly interpret
data visualizations. Doing this requires us to understand human
perception\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and perceptual phenomena}\DIFdelend , apply this understanding to data visualization design, and
test those designs in rigorous empirical work. Here, we present a
fully-reproducible, crowdsourced online experiment in which we
systematically \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{alter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{change }\DIFaddend visual features in scatterplots to correct for a
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{historic }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{well-known }\DIFaddend bias. We combine two techniques for correcting \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for }\DIFdelend correlation
underestimation in scatterplots and show that the effects are stronger
than what might be expected from simple additive combination. Building
on this, we present a framework for visualization design informed from
the ground up by human perception.

\subsection{Testing Correlation
Perception}\label{sec-testing-corr-percept}}

The testing of linear correlation perception in scatterplots has a long
and rich history, and has explored a wide variety of plot types, tasks,
and modeling methods. Work \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has involved participants engaged in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{involving participants }\DIFaddend making discrimination
judgements between scatterplots with different correlations
\citep{pollack_1960, doherty_2007} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, finding }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{found }\DIFaddend that performance on such tasks
became better as the objective \emph{r} value increased. This
performance \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on a discrimination judgement task }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tasks }\DIFaddend can also be modeled by deep neural networks
\citep{yang_2023}. Extensive work throughout the 1970s to 1990s focused
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{primarily on having participantsproduce a numerical estimate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on participants' numerical estimates }\DIFaddend of correlation, and found evidence
for a systematic \emph{underestimation} for positive \emph{r} values
besides 0 and 1. This underestimation was especially pronounced for 0.2
\textless{} \emph{r} \textless{} 0.6
\citep{strahan_1978, bobko_1979, cleveland_1982, lane_1985, lauer_1989, collyer_1990, meyer_1992}
and is demonstrated using an equation relating objective to subjective
correlation \citep{rensink_2017} in
Figure~\ref{fig-underestimation-curve}. More recent work has attempted
to model participants' correlation estimation performance by using a
combination of a bisection task, in which participants are asked to
adjust a plot until its correlation is halfway between that of two
reference plots, and a staircase method task designed to produce Just
Noticeable Differences between scatterplots such that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{they }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{their correlations
}\DIFaddend are discriminable 75\% of the time \citep{rensink_2010}. This work has
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also
}\DIFdelend been extended to incorporate Bayesian data analysis \citep{kay_2015},
which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is in agreement with other literature identifying }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also identifies }\DIFaddend scatterplots as particularly suited for the

experiment adapts techniques from previous work
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b} and combines them to further push the
envelope of how systematically adjusting visual features in scatterplots
can radically alter people's perceptions of correlation. For this reason
we use the same direct estimation paradigm to collect responses\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. This paradigm }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; this

enough that participants need little to no training.

\hypertarget{sec-drivers}{%
\subsection{Drivers of Correlation Perception}\label{sec-drivers}}

Evidence points towards correlation perception being driven by the shape
of the underlying probability distribution represented by scatterplot
points, however it should be noted that this is very much still an open
question, especially with regards to what low level perceptual
mechanisms may be at play. It is possible that there are different
contributory perceptual mechanisms operating at different levels based
on task-specific differences such as viewing time or levels of
graph-training. Increasing the \emph{x} and \emph{y} scales on a
scatterplot such that the size of the point cloud decreases
\citep{cleveland_1982} is associated with an increase in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a viewer'
s
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{viewers'
}\DIFaddend judgements of bivariate association, despite the objective \emph{r}
value remaining the same. It was suggested in this case that viewers may
have been using the area of the point cloud to judge association. Later
work found that the relationship between objective and perceived
\emph{r} values could be described by a function that included the mean
of the geometric distances between the points and the regression line
\citep{meyer_1997}. Investigation of the idea that people use visual
features to judge correlation provides evidence that, among \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{other
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{three other
equally predictive }\DIFaddend features, the standard deviation of all perpendicular
distances from scatterplot points to the regression line is predictive
of performance on a correlation estimation task \citep{yang_2019}.
Equations for both discrimination and magnitude estimation of
\DIFdelbegin \emph{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{in scatterplots
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{correlation }\DIFaddend include a quantity that is small when \emph{r} = 1 and
increases as \emph{r} approaches 0 \citep{rensink_2017}. This quantity
is indifferent to the type of visualization used \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(e.g.~line graphs and
bar charts \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{harrison_2014} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
or augmented stripplots
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{rensink_2017}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
)}\DIFaddend , and is functionally similar to that found in work
mentioned above \citep{cleveland_1982, meyer_1997, yang_2019}. Regarding
scatterplots, this quantity represents the average distance between data
points and the regression line, and can be thought of as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{representing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{closely
approximating }\DIFaddend the width of the underlying probability distribution.
Findings from a convolutional neural network that learnt visual features
related to correlation perception also support the idea that viewers are
using an aspect of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scatterplot shape }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the shape of the point cloud }\DIFaddend to judge correlation, or
some measure of what has been termed \emph{dot entropy}
\citep{yang_2023}, again considered a candidate visual proxy for
correlation judgements \citep{rensink_2017, rensink_2022}.

Recent work investigating the use of decay functions that change point
size or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend in scatterplots as a function of residual distance
provide evidence for both point density and salience/perceptual
weighting being drivers of correlation perception. The use of an
inverted \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay function \citep{strain_2023}, such that the
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend of a point decreased the closer it was to the regression line,
resulted in significantly lower and less accurate correlation estimates
compared to uniformly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{full-contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{full-opacity }\DIFaddend plots with the same overall shape.
This finding suggests that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the lower contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{lower opacity }\DIFaddend in the center of the
scatterplot biased viewers' perceptions down. When point \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend or size
are reduced as a function of distance from the regression line
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}, viewers rate correlation as
significantly higher and are significantly more accurate. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This supports
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These findings
support }\DIFaddend a low-level data salience account. Our aims are to test the
impact of systematically altering visual features on correlation
perception and to provide empirically-derived tools for visualization
designers to design better visualizations informed by the use of a
simple, reproducible framework.

Changing the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend of scatterplot points is standard practice to deal
with issues of overplotting \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{matejka_2015, bertini_2004}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{matejka_2015}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend ; scatterplots with very
large numbers of points, especially those with high degrees of overlap,
suffer from low individual-point visibility caused by high point
density. Lowering the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend of all points \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using alpha blending
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{few_2008} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend addresses this, and makes data trends and distributions
easier to see and interpret (see
Figure~\ref{fig-overplotting-examples}). In the present study we use the
\textbf{ggplot2} package \citep{hadley_gg2016} to create our stimuli.
This package uses an alpha parameter, or the level of linear
interpolation \citep{stone_2008} between foreground and background pixel
values, to set the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend of points. As demonstrated in
Figure~\ref{fig-alpha-examples}, an alpha value of 0 or 1 results in no
interpolation and rendering of either the background or foreground pixel
values respectively. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Psychophysical definitions of perceived
contrast}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Regarding the related concept of contrast,
psychophysical definitions }\DIFaddend are often based on what is being presented
(e.g., gratings) or are modeled to take into account aspects of human
vision (e.g., visibility limits) \citep{zuffi_2007}. Our crowdsourced
methodology gives us no control over the exact luminances of our
stimuli, only over the \emph{relative} differences in luminance between
scatterplot points and backgrounds. For this reason we do not report
absolute luminance nor make any attempt to adopt a formal definition of
contrast; instead we report the alpha value used. Given that our work
aims to improve correlation perception without removing data from the
scatterplot, we also incorporate point visibility testing (see
Section~\ref{sec-VT}). Informal point visibility piloting suggested that
our smallest, lowest \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast points had very }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity points had }\DIFaddend low visibility. We therefore
implemented an alpha = 0.2 floor for these points, which we judged as
conferring a sufficient level of point visibility \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the range of point
sizes we used}\DIFaddend .

Previous work has found that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lowering the contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{uniformly lowering the opacity }\DIFaddend of
\emph{all} scatterplot points relative to the background can increase
the level of underestimation error relative to full \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity}\DIFaddend , and that
lowering point \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend \emph{as a function of distance from the
regression line} is able to bias correlation estimates upwards to
partially correct for the underestimation observed \citep{strain_2023}.
Evidence suggests point salience/perceptual weighting or spatial
uncertainty as drivers for this effect. Lower stimulus contrast\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which
for isolated stimuli is functionally identical to lower opacity, is
}\DIFaddend associated with lower salience \citep{healey_2011}, can bias judgements
of mean point position \citep{hong_2021}, increase error in positional
judgements \citep{wehrhahn_1990}, and can result in greater uncertainty
in speed perception \citep{champion_2017}. Due to mechanistic accounts
of both salience/perceptual weighting and spatial uncertainty predicting
results in the same direction, previous work \citep{strain_2023} has
been unable to determine the extent to which each is responsible for the
observed reduction in correlation estimation error.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Micallef et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{micallef_2017} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
also found that ``merging, dark
dots'' optimally support correlation estimation; despite only changing
point opacity in a }\emph{\DIFadd{uniform}} \DIFadd{manner, the sheer number of points
used in that study results in scatterplots that appear similar to those
that reduce opacity as a function of residual error \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
That this technique has been shown to produce more accurate correlation
estimates as compared to unadjusted scatterplots may explain why the
optimization system employed in Micallef et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{micallef_2017}
}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
conferred benefits regarding correlation estimation.
}

\DIFaddend \hypertarget{sec-point-size}{%
\subsection{Point Size}\label{sec-point-size}}

For discriminability reasons, scatterplots visualizing large datasets
tend also to have smaller points. Bubble charts are a subclass of
scatterplot which use point size to describe a third variable, but what
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{little }\DIFdelend experimental work there is on the impact of point size on correlation
perception is inconclusive. Some work has found bias and variability in
correlation perception to be invariant to \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{both uniform and irregular
}\DIFaddend changes in point size \citep{rensink_2012, rensink_2014}, while
elsewhere a strong effect of changing point size as a function of
distance from the regression line has been reported
\citep{strain_2023b}. Evidence points towards a salience-dominant
mechanism in the latter case, albeit with a small effect of spatial
uncertainty. There is evidence that larger stimulus size is associated
with lower levels of spatial certainty \citep{alais_2004}, but higher
levels of salience \citep{healey_2011}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, results which are supported by
evidence that reaction times are slower to smaller stimuli
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{gramazio_2014, osaka_1976}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . The predicted effects of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these drivers }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{spatial
certainty and salience }\DIFaddend on correlation perception \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{work }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{operate }\DIFaddend in the opposite
direction to one another, which has allowed researchers to provide
evidence for the mechanistic dominance of salience when point size \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{decay
}\DIFaddend is used. When an inverted size decay function is used such that smaller
points are located nearer the regression line, correlation estimation is
significantly more accurate than when all points are the same size
\citep{strain_2023b}. In this case it was suggested that the higher
spatial uncertainty brought on by larger exterior points caused a
perceptual downweighting during correlation estimation, which is in line
with work suggesting \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{human }\DIFaddend perceptual systems make robust use of
visuo-spatial information
\citep{strain_2023b, warren_2002, warren_2004}. This effect was small,
meaning we do not take it into account when making our hypotheses. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our
hypotheses do, however, take into account the wider body of evidence
regarding stimulus size, perception, and attention. Hong et al.
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{hong_2021} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
found that larger stimuli could significantly alter
perceptions of global scatterplot means. Participants' estimates were
significantly biased towards areas with larger points, especially when a
wide range of point sizes were used and there was a high correlation
between point sizes and position. We formulate H3 according to these
findings.
}\DIFaddend 

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

We present a single experiment based on established effects of adjusting
point size and point \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity in scatterplots}\DIFaddend . In our study, we combine
previously independently tested point size and point \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay
functions in both \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard orientation (contrast}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical orientation (opacity}\DIFaddend /size is reduced with
residual magnitude) and inverted orientation (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity}\DIFaddend /size is increased
with residual magnitude). Throughout we refer to \emph{congruent} and
\emph{incongruent} conditions with respect to the combination of
orientations of size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay functions. We hypothesize that:
(H1) an increased reduction in correlation estimation error will be
observed when congruent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical }\DIFaddend orientation decay functions are used;
(H2) the use of congruent inverted orientation decay functions will
produce the least accurate estimates of correlation; and (H3) that owing
to the greater strength of the size channel observed in previous work
\citep{strain_2023b}, there will be a significant difference in
correlation estimates between the two incongruent orientation
conditions.

\subsection{Crowdsourcing}\label{sec-crowdsourcing}}

Much prior work into correlation perception in scatterplots has taken
place in-person, most often with graduate students with experience in
statistics. While this work is valuable, especially to perception
audiences, it can struggle to provide data that is resilient to
different viewing contexts and the wide range of levels of statistical
and graph experience present in lay populations. In addition, the ease
and low-cost afforded to us by online, crowdsourced experimental work is
unmatched. Given our intended HCI and design audience, we therefore
choose to crowdsource all participants. We acknowledge however, that the
technique has been affected by low quality data and skewed demographics
in the past \citep{chmielewski_2020, charalambides_2021, peer_2021}. In
light of these issues we follow published guidelines \citep{peer_2021}
to ensure the collection of high quality data. Namely, we use the
Prolific.co platform \citep{prolific} with stringent pre-screen
restrictions; participants were required to have completed at least 100
studies using Prolific, and were required to have a prolific score of
100, representing a 99\% approval rate. This is more strict than the
95\% suggested in previous work \citep{peer_2021}, but has served the
authors well in prior work.

45 scatterplot datasets were generated corresponding to 45 \emph{r}
values uniformly distributed between 0.2 and 0.99, as there is evidence
that very little correlation is perceived below \emph{r} = 0.2
\citep{strahan_1978, bobko_1979, cleveland_1982}. Using so many values
for \emph{r} allows us to paint a broader picture of people's perception

\subsection{Point Visibility Testing}\label{sec-VT}}

Discussions about the size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend of particular scatterplot points
are inherently difficult in the context of online, crowdsourced
experiments; controlling the devices participants use to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{participate in
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{complete }\DIFaddend these
kinds of experiments, beyond insisting on laptop or desktop computers,
is impossible. While this may result in a lack of consistency in
scatterplot point sizes, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{luminances}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacities}\DIFaddend , or contrast ratios between
participants, it also provides results that are more resilient to
different viewing contexts than traditional lab-based experimental work.
In addition to measures implemented to ensure high quality participant
data (see Section~\ref{sec-crowdsourcing}), it is also key that we do
not inadvertently remove data from scatterplots by including points
whose size or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend renders them invisible. We therefore included
point visibility testing\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to check this}\DIFdelend . Participants viewed six scatterplots that were
made up of a certain number of points between 2 and 7. These points were
of the same size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend as the smallest and lowest \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend points
used in the experimental items. Participants were asked to enter in a
textbox how many points were present. Participants scored an average of
74.89\% (\(SD\) = 32.25\%). Despite our use of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend floor
detailed in Section~\ref{sec-transparency-and-contrast}, it is clear
that some of our small, low \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend points were not reliably visible,
most likely due to low contrast between the point and background, as
previous work \citep{strain_2023b} found point visibility largely
invariant to size. We suggest this is due to differences in monitor
specifications between participants. In reality minimum visible \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{size and contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{point
size and opacity }\DIFaddend would need to be calibrated on a per-monitor basis. We
also include performance on the point visibility test as a fixed effect

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Both experiments were }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The experiment was }\DIFaddend built using PsychoPy \citep{pierce_2019} and hosted
on Pavlovia.org. Participants were only permitted to complete the
experiment on a desktop or laptop computer. Each participant was first
shown the participant information sheet and provided consent through key
presses in response to consent statements. They were asked to provide
their age in a free text box, followed by their gender identity.
Participants completed the 5-item Subjective Graph Literacy test
\citep{garcia_2016}, followed by the point visibility task described in
Section~\ref{sec-VT} and the screen scale task described in
Section~\ref{sec-dot-pitch}. Participants were given instructions, and
were then shown examples of scatterplots with correlations of \emph{r} =
0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.95, as piloting of a previous experiment indicated
some of the lay population may be unfamiliar with the visual character
of scatterplots. Section~\ref{sec-add-analyses} contains further
analysis of the potential training effects of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{displaying these plots}\DIFaddend .
Two practice trials were given before the experiment began. Participants
worked through a randomly presented series of 180 experimental trials
and were asked to use a slider to estimate correlation to 2 decimal
places. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Visual masks
preceded each
scatterplot }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Participants were asked to complete each trial as quickly and
accurately as possible, although there were no time limits on individual
trials. Visual masks were displayed for 1 second in between each
scatterplot presentation}\DIFaddend . Interspersed were 6 attention check trials
which explicitly asked participants to ignore the scatterplot and set
the slider to 0 or 1.

\hypertarget{sec-participants}{%
\subsection{Participants}\label{sec-participants}}

150 participants were recruited using the Prolific.co platform. Normal
to corrected-to-normal vision and English fluency were required for
participation. In addition, participants who had completed any of our
previous studies into correlation estimation in scatterplots (references
removed for anon) were prevented from participating. Data were collected
from 158 participants. 8 failed more than 2 out of 6 attention check
questions, and, as per pre-registration stipulations, were rejected from
the study. Data from the remaining 150 participants were included in the
full analysis (50.7\% male, 48.7\% female, and 0.7\% non-binary).
Participants' mean age was 30.6 (\emph{SD} = 8.6). Participants' mean
graph literacy score was 22.5 (\emph{SD} = 3.5) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{out of 30. }\DIFaddend The average
time taken to complete the experiment was 37 minutes (\emph{SD} = 12.3).

experimental items, along with 6 attention check items, in a fully

\DIFaddend Our first two hypotheses were fully supported in this experiment. The
combination of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical }\DIFaddend orientation size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay functions
produced the most accurate estimates of correlation, although this also
resulted in a large over-correction and consequent overestimation for
many values of \emph{r} (see Figure~\ref{fig-diff-error-bars-plot}). Our
second hypothesis was also supported; the combination of inverted size
and inverted \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay functions produced the least accurate
estimates of correlation. We found no support for our third hypothesis;
there was no significant difference in correlation estimates between
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical }\DIFaddend orientation size/inverted orientation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay plots and
inverted orientation size/\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard orientation contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical orientation opacity }\DIFaddend decay plots (Z =
-2.26, \emph{p} = .11), however we did find a significant interaction
effect that provides evidence that the combination of size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity
}\DIFaddend decay functions is not additive in nature.

We find no effects of graph literacy (\(\chi^2\)(1) = 3.50, \emph{p} =

\emph{p} = .257), or dot pitch (\(\chi^2\)(1) = 1.52, \emph{p} = .218)
on participants' errors in correlation estimation. We did find a
significant effect of training (\(\chi^2\)(1) = 23.78, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001), with participants rating correlation .01 lower during
the second half. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{While this effect is statistically significant}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This may imply that having more recently viewed the

\section{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}}

The finding of a significant interaction between point size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity
}\DIFaddend decay provides evidence that these functions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interact }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{combine }\DIFaddend in non-additive
ways. In addition, we provide further confirmatory evidence of what has
been found previously. Namely, that while manipulations of both point
size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend have significant effects, the effect of changing point
size is stronger, and that while we can influence correlation estimates
in either direction, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical }\DIFaddend orientation manipulations are more powerful
than inverted ones \citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}. As one would
expect, we also see an effect of orientation congruency on the extent to
which a manipulation can bias correlation estimates\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; redundant encoding,
such as that present here in congruent conditions, is known to support
visual grouping and segmentation. We now provide evidence that
redundancy can be exploited to change correlation perception. }\DIFaddend The lack
of support for our third hypothesis, that there would be a difference in
correlation estimates between incongruent conditions, was surprising
given the greater strength of the size channel relative to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity
}\DIFaddend demonstrated in previous work
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b, hong_2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , although this may be a
facet of the non-additive interaction between size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity
}\DIFaddend manipulations we found. Despite the lack of support for this hypothesis,
we did find that the size decay channel explained more variance (.104)
in our model than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay (.087) was able to.

Taking into account the present work, which manipulates point size and
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend together, and previous work manipulating the same visual
features in isolation, we provide recommendations to visualization
designers and researchers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The size decay function in isolation should be used when }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{When }\DIFaddend \emph{r} is between approximately 0.3 and 0.75\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. In this range it produces }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and the
  scatterplot in question is intended solely for the communication of
  correlation, designers may wish to implement the size decay function,
  as previous work \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023b} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
has shown it to produce }\DIFaddend the most
  accurate \DIFdelbegin \emph{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{estimates in participants}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{correlation estimates in this range}\DIFaddend .
\item
  Outside of this range, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the contrast decay function should be used in
  isolation, as here it produces the most accurate }\emph{\DIFdel{r}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{estimates}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and with the same caveats in place, designers
  may wish to implement the opacity decay function \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
;
  while its effect on correlation estimation is small, it does
  significantly increase estimation accuracy}\DIFaddend .
\item
  There exists a combination of size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay functions that
  produces accurate correlation estimates while maintaining the
  increased \emph{r} estimation precision that we would expect to see
  with high \emph{r} values. Finding this will require extensive future
  testing.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sec-combining}{%
\subsection{Combining Manipulations}\label{sec-combining}}

Figure~\ref{fig-emm-plot} and Figure~\ref{fig-diff-error-bars-plot} show
how, on average, the combination of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical }\DIFaddend orientation size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast decay functions has resulted }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity
decay functions results }\DIFaddend in an overestimation of \emph{r} for the
majority of values. While this does not \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{directly }\DIFdelend solve the underestimation
problem, it does demonstrate that with regards to using point size and
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend to bias viewer's estimates of correlation in scatterplots, there
would appear to be few limitations. If we can over-correct correlation
estimates, then we certainly have the ability to correct appropriately.
The issue here is not one of our \emph{ability} to change people's
perceptions, but of \emph{tuning} the use of these visual \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{factors }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{features }\DIFaddend to be
able to change people's perceptions in systematic ways. We explore what
further work would need to be done to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{achieve }\DIFaddend this in
Section~\ref{sec-future-work}. Combining inverted size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay
functions also had the predicted effect in this case, producing the
lowest and least accurate estimates of correlation. Combining inverted
manipulations did not, however, significantly change the shape of the
estimation curve (see Figure~\ref{fig-diff-error-bars-plot}). In
addition to interacting non-additively, the effects we observe operate
differently depending on the direction of the change induced in
perception. This finding can also explain the lack of support found for
our hypothesis that there would be a significant difference in \emph{r}
estimation error between the two incongruent conditions. Despite the
size channel being more powerful with regards to influencing correlation
estimates, the fact that this power depends on the direction the
function is set causes incongruent functions to act against each other
in ways we would not expect. Indeed, the incongruent condition that used
a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical }\DIFaddend orientation size decay function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{did exhibit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{exhibited }\DIFaddend lower mean error
than the one using inverted orientation size decay (see
Figure~\ref{fig-diff-error-bars-plot}), however in each case \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity
}\DIFaddend decay appears to have blunted the power of the size decay function to
the extent that the difference in errors is not statistically
significant.

\hypertarget{estimation-precision}{%
\subsection{Estimation Precision}\label{estimation-precision}}

Much previous work is consistent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with regards to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{regarding }\DIFaddend the finding that \emph{r}
estimation precision increases with the objective \emph{r} value
\citep{rensink_2010, rensink_2012, rensink_2014, rensink_2017, doherty_2007}.
More recent work using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{size or contrast decay functions similar to the
ones used here \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
has }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the same size or opacity decay functions (albeit
in isolation and without an opacity floor)
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend found that in some cases, precision in
\emph{r} estimation is \emph{constant} across the range of \emph{r}
values investigated. For example, the use of a size decay function,
whether using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical}\DIFaddend /inverted orientation non-linear functions or a
linear decay function, results in \textbf{no} change in \emph{r}
estimation precision \citep{strain_2023b}. When \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend is used in the
same ways, only an inverted decay function \textbf{does not} exhibit the
conventional increase in precision with \emph{r}. In the present work,
precision in \emph{r} estimation increased whenever a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard orientation contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical
orientation opacity }\DIFaddend decay function was used. We suggest this is part of
the moderating effect of the point \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay function on the size
decay function; the visual character of scatterplots with high \emph{r}
values that use the size decay function eliminates the usual increase in
precision we would expect, however the introduction of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay
function normalizes this to the point where precision is restored.

estimation error curve, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{whereas using size decaydoes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{while leaving its shape intact (compare opacity
manipulated and no manipulation present plots in
Figure~\ref{fig-est-multi-exp}). Using size decay, however, changes both
the amplitude and shape of the underestimation error curve (compare size
manipulated and no manipulation present plots in
Figure~\ref{fig-est-multi-exp})}\DIFaddend . When size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay functions
are combined, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{however, }\DIFdelend the shape appears similar to that of size alone. This is
in line with previous work establishing size as a more potent channel
for the manipulation of correlation estimates \citep{strain_2023b} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and
positional means \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{hong_2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . It would appear that the addition of
the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend curve moderates the effect of the size curve as a function
of the objective \emph{r} value itself, without affecting the general
shape of the curve. In the following, we briefly discuss the effects of
each manipulation in isolation and the manipulations together, before
making a case for the inclusion of both when tuning scatterplots for
correlation estimation due to the complementary benefits each confers.
Throughout the course of this section it should be noted that the
analyses include data from several separate experiments. We argue that
their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{methodological similarities render
comparison }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{use of near-identical decay equations (in isolation and without
the use of an opacity floor) and experimental paradigms render
comparisons }\DIFaddend appropriate, but we acknowledge the potential for overstated
conclusions \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

Using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an opacity }\DIFaddend decay function in isolation has a small effect on
correlation estimation. It does little to change the shape of the
underestimation curve (see Figure~\ref{fig-underestimation-curve}), but
slightly biases \emph{r} estimates up to partially correct for the
underestimation observed with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal }\DIFaddend scatterplots \citep{strain_2023}.
Importantly, it also preserves the increase in correlation estimation
precision \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with }\emph{\DIFadd{r}} \DIFaddend that we would expect to find during correlation
estimation tasks. Using the size decay function in isolation has a more
dramatic effect. The shape of the estimation curve is altered quite
radically, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{there is no increase in precision }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimation precision does not increase }\DIFaddend with the objective
\emph{r} value \citep{strain_2023b}. Size decay over-corrects at lower
values of \emph{r}, leading to an overestimation effect, while at high
values the curve begins to change direction, leading to a more severe
underestimation. In the middle range of \emph{r} values, however, the
size decay function in isolation performs well. One option for tuning
correlation estimation using these functions would therefore be to use
the size decay function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in isolation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{alone }\DIFaddend for mid-range values of \emph{r} (0.3 to
0.75), and to use the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast decay function in isolation
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity decay function }\DIFaddend outside of this range. Used
together however, we can exploit the power of the size decay function
whilst maintaining the expected increase in precision with \emph{r} that
the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay function confers. It is clear that the simple
combination we have used in the present study does not represent an
ideal tuning, as participants overestimated \emph{r} for the majority of
values, but this confirms that there is the scope to bias \emph{r}
estimates significantly using the functions supplied here. Further work
would be required to obtain precise measures of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{power
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contributions }\DIFaddend of
each decay function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and their power together}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{when they are used together, as their combination is
not linearly additive}\DIFaddend . Doing this would allow us to tune each function
according to both objective \emph{r} value and the tuning of the other
function to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{produce }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{facilitate more }\DIFaddend accurate correlation estimates. We can
derive new curves that describe the effect that each manipulation and
the combination of manipulations has on correlation estimates
(Figure~\ref{fig-power-plot}) by comparing them to estimates without any
manipulation present. We term this `power'. The dotted line on each plot
shows the power \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we would need }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that would be needed }\DIFaddend to correct for the standard
underestimation curve (see Figure~\ref{fig-underestimation-curve}). As
we can see, size alone provides the closest to the requirement, and
combining size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay functions results in gross
overestimation. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure~\ref{fig-power-plot} includes the integral of
each power curve over }\emph{\DIFadd{r}}\DIFadd{, a measure of the total power of each
curve. We also display the difference between this integral and the
integral of each required- power curve over }\emph{\DIFadd{r}}\DIFadd{, which shows to
what extent the power we observed differs from what would be required.

\subsection{Mechanisms}\label{sec-mechs}}

Previous work has made the case for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend and size decay acting
primarily through salience/perceptual weighting \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{regarding correlation
estimation}\DIFaddend , with the caveat that spatial certainty also plays a small
part in the mechanism behind size decay \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023b}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Our
results are supportive of this notion, with our highest and lowest
estimates being observed in the congruent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical }\DIFaddend and congruent inverted
conditions respectively. These findings also support dot density
\citep{yang_2023} and feature-based attentional bias accounts
\citep{hong_2021, sun_2016}. As all of these mechanisms would be
expected to operate in the same direction, making conclusions about the
relative contributions of each is difficult. The body of evidence
generally points to a high-level probability distribution account
\citep{rensink_2017, rensink_2022}. On a lower level, numerous candidate
mechanisms exist, which are mostly expected to act in the same
direction. Previous work concluded that spatial certainty
\citep{strain_2023b} may play a small role with regards to the effects
of size decay on correlation perception; our results neither confirm nor
refute this, but instead provide further evidence for
salience/perceptual weighting/dot density changing participants'
perceptions of the width of a probability distribution to affect
correlation estimates. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Hong et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{hong_2021} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
found that the
inclusion of larger or more opaque scatterplot points was able to bias
estimates of positional means, but that the relative contributions
(weights) of these visual features with regards to perception change as
a function of the ranges of sizes/opacities used. It is clear from this
evidence and the present study that the perceptual weights of point size
and opacity are not the same.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{sec-limitations}}

Firstly, our participants' performance on the point visibility task was
poor, with an average score of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{only }\DIFdelend 74.89\%. It is clear from these results
that for many participants, the smallest and lowest \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend points we
used were simply not visible, although it would seem that this low
visibility had no significant effect on correlation estimates.
Regardless, for many of our participants it will have appeared that we
were removing data, which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{goes against }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{violates }\DIFaddend our intended aims. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Solving }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Addressing }\DIFaddend this
would require a by-participant calibration of point size and point
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity}\DIFaddend , which is beyond the scope of our current methodology, as it
would require stimuli to be fully re-generated for each participant. We
aim to implement this in the future, although it would require \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a
different platform , such as a server-based instance of Rstudio being run
in the background to re-generate stimuli }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the use
of a platform such that experimental stimuli could be regenerated }\DIFaddend per a
calibration task completed by the participant. We cannot say precisely
what proportions of the observed effect in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{typical }\DIFaddend orientation
congruent condition were due to size or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay. We can conclude
that these effects are not linearly additive, but must suggest further
work to define precisely each of their contributions. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{While our
provision of dot pitch measurements is a step in the right direction,
the present methodology leaves us unable to comment on the variability
in participants' viewing contexts. We argue that our large sample size
and recruitment from lay populations renders our conclusions resilient
to changes in viewing contexts, but further, in-person, experimentation
is planned to confirm this.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Due to extensive previous testing of no-adjustment, size-only, and
opacity-only manipulation scatterplots
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
, we choose not to include these as
conditions in the present work. We did not consider the increased costs
and experimental length worth the inclusion of three extra conditions,
although we acknowledge that these would assist us in making claims
about additivity and the relative contributions of point size and
opacity decay.
}

\DIFadd{Channels such as point size, colour, opacity, and shape have been used
in past work to encode variables beyond the standard two in scatterplots
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{hong_2021, smart_2019}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. While we focus purely on correlation
estimation in the present work, we acknowledge that the use of our
techniques is likely to lead to incorrect interpretations, especially
when scatterplots are designed with other tasks in mind. Given evidence
that size, shape, and colour and not entirely separable scatterplot
features \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{smart_2019}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
, if viewers assume that variations in point
size/opacity correspond to additional encoded variables, confounds in
interpretation may be introduced. As our contribution in this paper is
providing evidence that changing certain visual features in systematic
ways can alter viewers' estimates of correlation, we do not consider
this to be problematic. If charts such as the ones we have presented
were to appear in the wild, however, it would be necessary to clarify
that such charts were designed to aid in the rapid and intuitive
interpretation of correlation (and }\emph{\DIFadd{only}} \DIFadd{this).
}

\DIFadd{While we put forward salience as the most likely driver of the effects
on correlation estimation we observe when using point size/opacity
manipulations, the data we have gathered do not allow us to comment on
the reasons behind the differences in the shapes of the estimation error
curves (see Figure~\ref{fig-est-multi-exp}). The context that the
manipulation is used in (i.e.~the }\emph{\DIFadd{r}} \DIFadd{value of the scatterplot)
interacts with point size and opacity manipulations in complex ways. To
understand how point size/opacity manipulations operate in more detail,
future work may wish to choose fewer }\emph{\DIFadd{r}} \DIFadd{values and instead vary
the type of decay equation/range of sizes/opacities, but this is beyond
the scope of the current work.
}

\subsection{Future Work}\label{sec-future-work}}

There is evidence that viewers overestimate correlation in negatively
correlated scatterplots \citep{sher_2017}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Future work may make use of the functions and findings we have provided to begin solving this
problem}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Findings that correlation
perception in negatively correlated scatterplots functions symmetrically
to that of positively correlated scatterplots \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{harrison_2014}
}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
suggest that the techniques we have implemented in the current paper may
be used (in a symmetrical manner) to address the overestimation bias}\DIFaddend . We
found evidence that the influence of size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay functions
changes according to the direction they are operating in, meaning
experimental work with negatively correlated scatterplots would be
required, and results may differ significantly from findings related to
the underestimation of correlation in positively correlated
scatterplots. For size and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend decay in the present work we used
equation 1. Given our finding that the combination is non-additive,
there are a multitude of adjustable parameters for each decay function
that require rigorous testing in order to produce concrete values of the
contributions of each. The value of \emph{b} is one such parameter. We
used the same value of \emph{b} (0.25) as in previous work
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b}. Changing this value can increase or
decrease the severity of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effect }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{decay function }\DIFaddend in question. Additionally,
we used a constant and a scaling factor with the size decay manipulation
to ensure our points were visible. These values could also be changed.
Aside from changing aspects of equation 1, there are other equations
that could be used, including ones that take into account objective
\emph{r} value to change the values used to set point size or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast.
The present work
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity.
Future experimental work may use the major axis through the probability
ellipse instead of the regression line as a baseline to change point
sizes and opacities; evidence that people often report the major axis
when asked to visually estimate the regression line \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{collyer_1990}
}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
suggests that this may produce a different pattern of results from those
seen here. If changes in dot density are driving changes in correlation
estimates, the congruent conditions here are an example of redundant
encoding. Future work may explore using different channels to
redundantly encode dot density, such as marker shape, orientation, or
color. The present study }\DIFaddend opens the door for this future work, as it
provides the necessary additional data to previous experiments using
only size \citep{strain_2023b} or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opacity }\DIFaddend \citep{strain_2023} decay
functions. Further testing of these manipulations in isolation and
combination using different decay function parameters will allow
researchers to build a more complete picture of how these visual
features impact correlation estimation, and how we can exploit them to
correct for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{historic }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{well-known }\DIFaddend biases.

Through this work we also provide an example of an experimental
framework that we argue should be employed to test a wider range of data
visualizations, statistical summaries, and task types. Our framework is
fully open source, and can be easily adapted for other charts and
modalities. Doing this furthers the cause of empirically-informed data
visualization design.
